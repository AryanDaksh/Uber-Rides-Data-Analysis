## Introduction

The Uber Rides Data Analysis project aims to understand the behavior of Uber riders by analyzing ride data. The project dives into ride frequency, distance covered, and purpose of rides, and visualizes the data to identify patterns and trends.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes details of Uber rides such as:
- `START_DATE`
- `END_DATE`
- `CATEGORY`
- `START`
- `STOP`
- `MILES`
- `PURPOSE`

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
1. **Trip Frequency**: Number of rides taken over different periods.
2. **Distance Analysis**: Distribution of ride distances.
3. **Ride Purpose**: Categorization of rides based on purpose (e.g., Business, Personal).
4. **Start and Stop Points**: Popular areas for starting and stopping rides.
5. **Time Analysis**: When rides are most commonly taken (day, month, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and processing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For presenting the analysis.
